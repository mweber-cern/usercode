AdvancedROOTAnalyzer, (C) 2011 Martin Weber
===========================================

This package is thought to be a simple-to-use tool for analysing
ROOT files that were generated with ACSUSYAna, but can easily be
extended to be used in other analysis, too.

For installation and how to use, please consult the TWiki
